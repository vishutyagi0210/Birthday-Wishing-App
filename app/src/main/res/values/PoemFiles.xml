    <string name="secondPoem">"A chance to rewind, a chance to undo,\nTo change the words that hurt you,\nI remember our last talk, the timing so clear,\nIt was a Saturday evening, around six to eight, dear.\n\nIf I could turn back time, I'd make it right,\nI'd never let those words slip out of sight,\nI said goodbye, but I didn't want to,\nThree reasons in my mind, but none of them true.\n\nI stopped talking to you, and it hurt so bad,\nBut now I realize, those reasons were just a fad,\nI want to tell you what they were, and why they were wrong,\nAnd if you'll give me a chance, our friendship can be strong.\n\nLet's start from scratch, like we never met,\nAnd build something beautiful, something we won't regret,\nI hope you can forgive me, and we can move on,\nTogether we'll make memories, until the break of dawn.\n\n"</string>
